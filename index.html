  <p>If you are seeing this, it means that you have JavaScript disabled. Please enable JavaScript to access the locked link.</p>

  <p>This application is entirely programmed in JavaScript. This was done intentionally, so that all encryption and decryption happens client-side. This means the code runs as a distributed application, relying only on GitHub Pages for infrastructure. It also means that no data about locked links is ever stored on a server. The code is designed to be auditable so users can investigate what is happening behind the scenes.</p>

  <p>If you still want to run the application, I encourage you to clone the <a href="https://github.com/jstrieb/link-lock">source code on GitHub</a>. That way you can disable JavaScript only for trusted files on your local machine.</p>
